# Learning Rust! Using the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)

In school, I loved coding in C / C++ / Assembly, but haven't had a chance to do any of it since graduating. Everything I've heard about Rust make it sound like it could be a very important language going forward. 

## Things I'd like to accomplish with Rust
* Create a web service (API, real time chat, etc)
* Learn more about real-time computing, applications at scale, and lower level concepts
